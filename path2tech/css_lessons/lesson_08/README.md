# Lesson 08 Lab

In this lab we will practice using media queries for mobile response.

## Step 1
- In `style.css` in the media query that uses "min-width: 800px" change the height to 600px, width to 600px and flex-direction to column of any element that has a class of "card".

Example Code:
```css
.card {
  height: 600px;
  width: 600px;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

## Step 2
- In `style.css` in the media query that uses "min-width: 800px" change the background color of any element that has a class of "item-1" to the color "green"

Example Code:
```css
.item-1 {
  background-color: green;
}
```

## Step 3
- In `style.css` in the media query that uses "min-width: 800px" change the background color of any element that has a class of "item-2" to the color "orange"

Example Code:
```css
.item-2 {
  background-color: orange;
}
```
